# Cybersecurity Disinformation Detection Briefing System (CDDBS)

> Cybersecurity Disinformation Detection Briefing System (CDDBS)
This repository documents the research, prototyping, and testing of an automated system that collects, analyzes, and summarizes media narratives for disinformation analysis.

The project implements a multi-stage pipeline (Fetch → Analyze → Digest → Translate → Summarize) and adheres to intelligence community briefing standards.
