meddling claim\\n\\n    \\n                    Pavel Durov stated earlier that French intelligence had wanted his platform to censor some channels ahead of last year’s vote\\n            FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk. ©\\xa0                Global Look Press / Pool via CNP / Francis ChungElon Musk has drawn attention to Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s allegation that France had attempted to interfere in last year’s Moldovan presidential elections.The US-based billionaire shared an X post by his fellow tech entrepreneur claiming French intelligence had requested that his platform censor certain channels ahead of last year’s vote.“Wow,” the SpaceX and Tesla CEO commented in his re-post of the message. Durov published his statement on Sunday as Moldovans were again heading to the polls to take part in the parliamentary vote.In his statement, the Telegram founder claimed that the intelligence agency had approached him last year, seeking his aid in censoring a number of channels ahead of the vote. In exchange, it offered the businessman, who holds French citizenship, some assistance in a criminal case pending against him in France.Although some of the channels flagged by the spies did violate Telegram’s rules and were removed, others were legitimate but expressed views unpopular with the French and Moldovan authorities, according to Durov.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more\\nTelegram’s Durov claims French intelligence tried to blackmail him over Moldovan election\\n\\n\\n\\nThe tech entrepreneur also called the actions of the French spies “unacceptable,” arguing that their offer constituted interference into the judicial process and the exploitation of his own legal situation in France.Durov was arrested at a Paris airport in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was eventually released on €5 million ($5.4 million) bail and placed under judicial supervision.Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who holds a staunch pro-EU position, was re-elected in 2024 amid allegations of electoral irregularities, with opposition groups claiming that key votes came from the country’s diaspora in the EU.Earlier, Durov made similar claims about French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally asking him to censor conservatives in Romania ahead of the presidential election rerun in May. The businessman said he rejected the request. Paris has vehemently denied the accusations.Musk voiced his support for the fellow tech entrepreneur at the time as well, by responding to his May remarks with a brief post: “Hear, hear!”\\n            You can share this story on social media:\\n        Follow RT onElon MuskFranceMoldovaPavel DurovTelegram\\n    Dear readers!

Telegraph\\n\\n    \\n                    The US president had previously insisted that Kiev would need to abandon some of its territorial claims\\n            King Charles III and US President Donald Trump, September 17, 2025, Windsor, England  ©\\xa0Getty Images /                 Anna MoneymakerUS President Donald Trump’s newly adopted stance on the Ukraine conflict was shaped by his recent UK visit, The Telegraph has reported, citing unnamed sources. Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff Andrey Yermak has told the newspaper that the visit was very important.\\xa0For months, Washington insisted that Kiev would need to give up on certain territorial claims for a US-mediated peace deal with Moscow to move forward. This week, however, the US President reversed course. He dismissed Russia as a “paper tiger” that Kiev could defeat and said his shift came from “getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine-Russia military and economic situation.”Earlier this month, Trump visited the UK, one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters since the conflict intensified in February 2022. During the trip, the American leader met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called for increased pressure on Russia. Trump also visited Windsor Castle, where he was lavishly hosted by King Charles.Yermak praised the king’s efforts. “I’d like to mention that it was a great visit of President Trump to the United Kingdom, and I know the position of His Majesty, the position of Prime Minister Starmer, and the people whom President Trump met… it was very important,” he told the British newspaper on Friday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE: Trump’s praise of Ukrainian military a ‘strategic move’ to entice talks – NYP\\n\\n\\nDiplomatic sources suggested it was no coincidence that Trump’s change of heart came so soon after his conversations with Charles, the outlet reported.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has flatly rejected the ceding of territory by Russia. He also scoffed at Trump’s “paper tiger” remark, insisting that Russia has traditionally been seen as a bear, and that there is “no such thing as a paper bear.”On Wednesday, Peskov added that Trump’s recent statements appeared to have been made following a meeting with Zelensky at the UN General Assembly earlier this week, and that they sharply contrasted with Russia’s view.Ukraine lays claim to the Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk People’s Republics (LPR), Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as well as the Crimean peninsula. Moscow has repeatedly signaled the status of its new territories is not negotiable and regards them as an integral part of Russia.\\n            You can share this story on social media:\\n        Follow RT onDonald TrumpRussia-Ukraine conflictUKUSUkraine\\n    Dear readers!

He claimed that intelligence services contacted him through an intermediary and asked Telegram to remove a number of Moldovan channels before a presidential vote.According to St Petersburg native Durov, Telegram did delete some flagged channels that clearly violated its own policies. But he said the intermediary later relayed a more troubling message: French intelligence had offered to “say good things” to the judge in charge of his case in exchange for wider cooperation.“This was unacceptable on several levels,” Durov wrote, adding that if the agency did contact the judge, it would amount to interference in the judicial process — and if it didn’t, it meant exploiting his legal jeopardy to influence political developments abroad.Durov said that shortly afterward, Telegram received a second list of “problematic” Moldovan channels. Unlike the first batch, he insisted, nearly all of these accounts were legitimate and fully compliant with Telegram’s rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE: France pressured Telegram to silence Romanian conservatives – founder\\n\\n\\nTheir only common trait, he said, was that they voiced political positions disliked by the Moldovan and French governments. “We refused to act on this request,” he wrote.The allegations come as Moldovans head to the polls in a high-stakes parliamentary election. President Maia Sandu’s pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) is facing off against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which campaigns for Moldova’s constitutional neutrality and accuses the government of suppressing dissent.In recent weeks, election officials barred two opposition parties over alleged foreign funding, adding to a list that already included the banned Victory Bloc and the dissolved SOR Party.Opposition groups accuse Sandu of tilting the playing field by restricting polling stations in Russia, where hundreds of thousands of Moldovans live, while opening hundreds across the EU — many in small towns. They also point to the closure of dozens of media outlets critical of the government.Commenting on Durov’s claims, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the revelations confirmed what Moscow had long alleged. “The West operates without conscience on all fronts,” she said.Durov, who also holds French citizenship in addition to his primary Russian, was arrested in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million bail but placed under judicial supervision. He said the French attempt to link that case to Moldovan politics was “a pattern we have also observed elsewhere, including in Romania.”Durov insisted Telegram would not comply with political censorship. “Telegram is committed to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons.

The electoral body has certified the validity of the vote.The residents of the predominately Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria have complained that the authorities in Chisinau have blocked bridges across the Dniester River in order to prevent them from reaching polling stations.Officials in Chisinau and Brussels present it as a democratic milestone, while the opposition contends the script has been pre-written.The race pits President Maia Sandu’s pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which is campaigning for Moldova’s constitutional neutrality.Sandu, first elected in 2020 and narrowly re-elected in 2024, has faced recurring claims of presiding over electoral irregularities. Opposition groups insist that decisive votes last year came from Moldovans living in EU countries. At the same time, Moscow accused Chisinau of disenfranchising citizens living in Russia, where only a handful of polling stations were opened compared with hundreds across Western Europe.\\n\\nREAD MORE:  \\n  Everything that doesn’t add up about the EU’s next ‘success story’: Signs Moldova’s election was decided before the first vote\\nOn Friday, the Central Election Commission barred two more opposition parties – Greater Moldova and Heart of Moldova – accusing them of taking undeclared foreign funds and violating campaign rules.

the age of 52. The news came just hours after the conclusion of an Arab League Summit, following which Nasser personally escorted Kuwaiti Emir Sabah III home. The man whom millions regarded as their leader and protector died as a result of a sudden heart attack.An estimated five million people came to Nasser’s funeral in Cairo. Every Arab head of state came to pay their last respects, except for King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, whose relations with Nasser had deteriorated over the Yemeni war. King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat wept at the funeral, while Muammar Gaddafi, who idolized Nasser, fainted twice. In Beirut, mournful demonstrations erupted into riots, resulting in 14 fatalities. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, tens of thousands of Palestinians marched, chanting, “Nasser will never die!”That day, from Algiers to Aden the streets resonated with a single question, “Why did you leave us, Gamal?” For millions of Arabs, his death symbolized not just the loss of a man, but the shattering of a dream – a dream of unity, independence, and the revival of a civilization he embodied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE: ‘We have provided everything possible for their freedom’: How the USSR helped France’s most important colony stick it to Paris\\n\\n\\nMilitary man: The path to leadershipGamal Abdel Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria to a modest family; his father worked as a postal clerk. Due to his father’s profession the family often relocated, so young Gamal attended schools in various cities in Egypt.Nasser began to display political and organizational skills in his early teens by participating in demonstrations against British intervention in Egyptian affairs. He even led one such protest where he engaged in a scuffle with the police, sustaining a minor head injury that earned him media attention.At the same time, Nasser was captivated by books on Islam and biographies of great historical leaders. He was particularly drawn to the ideas of Egyptian nationalists, including politician Mustafa Kamel and poet Ahmed Shawqi.Later, he credited his revolutionary zeal to the writer Tawfiq al-Hakim, who, in one of his novels, emphasized the need for a strong leader to realize the aspirations and hopes of the Egyptian people.When Nasser entered the Military Academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, who would become his steadfast allies. Both would later rise to high positions in the government: Amer became Egypt’s vice president in 1958, while Sadat succeeded Nasser as president after his death.In 1942, as a lieutenant in the infantry, Nasser was admitted to the General Staff Academy, where he began to actively recruit like-minded nationalists committed to overthrowing the pro-British King Farouk I.Nasser acquired combat experience during the Arab-Israeli war in the late 1940s, serving with the Sixth Infantry Battalion. Later, he taught at the military college of the General Sta',\n","   'analysis': '## Intelligence Analyst Briefing Report\\n\\n**1.

Recommended Actions:**\\n*   **Cross-Reference:** Seek independent verification of Pavel Durov\\'s claim regarding French intelligence and the Moldovan election from reputable, non-state-affiliated news sources.\\n*   **Monitor for Amplification:** Observe if this claim is further amplified by other Russian state media or associated disinformation networks.\\n*   **Contextualize:** When encountering this narrative, consider the source\\'s geopolitical agenda and the lack of independent corroboration for the central claim.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Intelligence Analyst Briefing Report**\\n\\n**1.

Key Claims**\\n*   RT reports, citing *The Telegraph*, that \"Trump’s Ukraine shift [is] tied to King Charles.\" (Claim by RT, attributed to *The Telegraph*)\\n*   RT claims that U.S. President Donald Trump had previously insisted that Ukraine (represented by Kyiv) would need to abandon some of its territorial claims. (Claim by RT)\\n*   RT implies there has been a \"shift\" in Trump\\'s position regarding Ukraine. (Implied by RT\\'s headline and narrative)\\n\\n**3. Disinformation Analysis**\\n*   **Pattern:** This report from RT, a state-funded Russian media outlet, aligns with common Russian disinformation patterns aimed at undermining Western unity and portraying Western leaders as susceptible to external, non-democratic influences.\\n*   **Framing:** The narrative frames a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding Ukraine as being influenced by a foreign monarch (King Charles III). This framing can serve to:\\n    *   **Sow distrust:** Suggests that U.S. policy is not solely driven by national interests or democratic processes, but by opaque external pressures.\\n    *   **Create division:** Implies a lack of autonomy or consistency in Western leadership, potentially fostering skepticism among international audiences.\\n    *   **Pre-position narratives:** If Trump\\'s policy on Ukraine does evolve, this narrative could be used to explain it as a result of external manipulation\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Intelligence Briefing: RT Article Analysis\\n\\n**1.

Key Claims**\\n*   **Claim by RT:** An unspecified commission has certified the validity of a Moldovan parliamentary vote. (Title)\\n*   **Claim by RT:** Ahead of the poll, the \"pro-Western government\" of Moldova banned several opposition parties. (Subtitle/Lede)\\n*   **Claim by RT (attributing to critics):** Unspecified \"critics\" are accusing the Moldovan government of \"foul play\" regarding the election. (Subtitle/Lede)\\n*   **Claim by RT:** Voters were observed arriving at a polling station in Chisinau to cast their ballots.\\n\\n**3. Disinformation Analysis**\\n*   **Narrative Type and Framing:** The article employs a \"questioning of legitimacy\" narrative. While the title states a commission certified the vote, the immediate follow-up introduces significant doubt by claiming the \"pro-Western government\" banned opposition parties and is accused of \"foul play.\" This framing aims to undermine the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the Moldovan electoral process and the government itself.\\n*   **Actor Framing:** The Moldovan government is explicitly labeled \"pro-Western,\" a common framing by Russian state media to imply external influence or alignment against Russian interests. The \"critics\" are left unspecified, making their accusations difficult to verify.\\n*   **Emotional Language:** The term \"foul play,\" attributed to \"critics\" by RT, implies dishonesty, unfairness, or cheating, contributing to the narrative of illegitimacy and potentially inciting distrust in the electoral outcome.\\n*   **Propaganda Pattern:** This aligns with a pattern of \"undermining democratic processes\" and \"delegitimization of opposing governments,\" frequently observed in Russian state media coverage of countries perceived as aligned with the West or critical of Russia.\\n\\n**4. Credibility Assessment**\\n*   **Confidence:** Low to Medium. While RT reports a commission certified the vote, the article immediately introduces counter-narratives from unspecified \"critics\" and claims about banned opposition parties, which are presented as facts by RT without specific evidence or attribution.\\n*   **Missing Sources:** The \"commission\" that certified the vote is not identified. The \"critics\" making accusations of \"foul play\" are not specified, nor are the specific opposition parties allegedly banned.\\n*   **Cross-check Needs:**\\n    *   Verification of the identity of the\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Intelligence Briefing: RT Article Analysis\\n\\n**1.

Key Claims**\\n\\nAccording to RT, the article presents Gamal Abdel Nasser as a figure who:\\n*   \"defied Britain.\"\\n*   \"challenged Israel.\"\\n*   \"became a godlike hero to Gaddafi and millions of Arabs.\"\\n*   \"remains a symbol of pan-Arabism and the unfulfilled dream of unity\" for millions.\\n*   His \"sudden death\" on September 28, 1970, significantly impacted the Middle East.\\n\\n**3. Disinformation Analysis**\\n\\n*   **Narrative Type and Framing:** The article employs a narrative of heroic glorification, positioning Gamal Abdel Nasser as a revered figure who successfully opposed Western (Britain) and regional (Israel) interests. This framing aligns with common anti-Western and anti-Zionist sentiments often promoted by RT. The use of terms like \"godlike hero\" and \"unfulfilled dream of unity\" aims to evoke strong emotional responses and admiration.\\n*   **Propaganda Patterns:**\\n    *   **Anti-Western/Anti-Imperialist:** The emphasis on Nasser \"defying Britain\" serves to highlight historical grievances against Western colonial powers, a recurring theme in RT\\'s content.\\n    *   **Selective History/Historical Revisionism:** The narrative focuses exclusively on Nasser\\'s perceived positive attributes and opposition to specific entities, potentially downplaying or omitting complex aspects of his rule, human rights record, or the broader geopolitical context.\\n    *   **Cult of Personality:** The description of Nasser as a \"godlike hero\" and a lasting \"symbol\" contributes to the creation or reinforcement of a cult of personality around an anti-Western leader.\\n*   **Tone:** The tone is highly positive, reverential, and emotional, designed to elicit strong support and admiration for Nasser and his ideals of pan-Arabism.\\n*   **Linguistic Analysis:** Terms such as \"defied,\" \"challenged,\" \"godlike hero,\" \"shaken,\" \"symbol,\" and \"unfulfilled dream\" are emotionally charged and contribute to the article\\'s persuasive and glorifying intent. This language is consistent with RT\\'s broader strategy of using evocative rhetoric to shape perceptions.\\n\\n**4. Credibility Assessment**\\n\\n*   **Confidence:** Moderate.
