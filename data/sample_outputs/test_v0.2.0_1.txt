Durov published his statement on Sunday as Moldovans were again heading to the polls to take part in the parliamentary vote.In his statement, the Telegram founder claimed that the intelligence agency had approached him last year, seeking his aid in censoring a number of channels ahead of the vote. In exchange, it offered the businessman, who holds French citizenship, some assistance in a criminal case pending against him in France.Although some of the channels flagged by the spies did violate Telegram’s rules and were removed, others were legitimate but expressed views unpopular with the French and Moldovan authorities, according to Durov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\nTelegram’s Durov claims French intelligence tried to blackmail him over Moldovan election\n\n\n\nThe tech entrepreneur also called the actions of the French spies “unacceptable,” arguing that their offer constituted interference into the judicial process and the exploitation of his own legal situation in France.Durov was arrested at a Paris airport in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was eventually released on €5 million ($5.4 million) bail and placed under judicial supervision.Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who holds a staunch pro-EU position, was re-elected in 2024 amid allegations of electoral irregularities, with opposition groups claiming that key votes came from the country’s diaspora in the EU.Earlier, Durov made similar claims about French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally asking him to censor conservatives in Romania ahead of the presidential election rerun in May. The businessman said he rejected the request. Paris has vehemently denied the accusations.Musk voiced his support for the fellow tech entrepreneur at the time as well, by responding to his May remarks with a brief post: “Hear, hear!”\n            You can share this story on social media:\n        Follow RT onElon MuskFranceMoldovaPavel DurovTelegram\n    Dear readers!

Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff Andrey Yermak has told the newspaper that the visit was very important.\xa0For months, Washington insisted that Kiev would need to give up on certain territorial claims for a US-mediated peace deal with Moscow to move forward. This week, however, the US President reversed course. He dismissed Russia as a “paper tiger” that Kiev could defeat and said his shift came from “getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine-Russia military and economic situation.”Earlier this month, Trump visited the UK, one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters since the conflict intensified in February 2022. During the trip, the American leader met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called for increased pressure on Russia. Trump also visited Windsor Castle, where he was lavishly hosted by King Charles.Yermak praised the king’s efforts. “I’d like to mention that it was a great visit of President Trump to the United Kingdom, and I know the position of His Majesty, the position of Prime Minister Starmer, and the people whom President Trump met… it was very important,” he told the British newspaper on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Trump’s praise of Ukrainian military a ‘strategic move’ to entice talks – NYP\n\n\nDiplomatic sources suggested it was no coincidence that Trump’s change of heart came so soon after his conversations with Charles, the outlet reported.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has flatly rejected the ceding of territory by Russia. He also scoffed at Trump’s “paper tiger” remark, insisting that Russia has traditionally been seen as a bear, and that there is “no such thing as a paper bear.”On Wednesday, Peskov added that Trump’s recent statements appeared to have been made following a meeting with Zelensky at the UN General Assembly earlier this week, and that they sharply contrasted with Russia’s view.Ukraine lays claim to the Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk People’s Republics (LPR), Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as well as the Crimean peninsula. Moscow has repeatedly signaled the status of its new territories is not negotiable and regards them as an integral part of Russia.\n            You can share this story on social media:\n        Follow RT onDonald TrumpRussia-Ukraine conflictUKUSUkraine\n    Dear readers!

But he said the intermediary later relayed a more troubling message: French intelligence had offered to “say good things” to the judge in charge of his case in exchange for wider cooperation.“This was unacceptable on several levels,” Durov wrote, adding that if the agency did contact the judge, it would amount to interference in the judicial process — and if it didn’t, it meant exploiting his legal jeopardy to influence political developments abroad.Durov said that shortly afterward, Telegram received a second list of “problematic” Moldovan channels. Unlike the first batch, he insisted, nearly all of these accounts were legitimate and fully compliant with Telegram’s rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: France pressured Telegram to silence Romanian conservatives – founder\n\n\nTheir only common trait, he said, was that they voiced political positions disliked by the Moldovan and French governments. “We refused to act on this request,” he wrote.The allegations come as Moldovans head to the polls in a high-stakes parliamentary election. President Maia Sandu’s pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) is facing off against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which campaigns for Moldova’s constitutional neutrality and accuses the government of suppressing dissent.In recent weeks, election officials barred two opposition parties over alleged foreign funding, adding to a list that already included the banned Victory Bloc and the dissolved SOR Party.Opposition groups accuse Sandu of tilting the playing field by restricting polling stations in Russia, where hundreds of thousands of Moldovans live, while opening hundreds across the EU — many in small towns. They also point to the closure of dozens of media outlets critical of the government.Commenting on Durov’s claims, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the revelations confirmed what Moscow had long alleged. “The West operates without conscience on all fronts,” she said.Durov, who also holds French citizenship in addition to his primary Russian, was arrested in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million bail but placed under judicial supervision. He said the French attempt to link that case to Moldovan politics was “a pattern we have also observed elsewhere, including in Romania.”Durov insisted Telegram would not comply with political censorship. “Telegram is committed to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons. I will continue to expose every attempt to ',

The electoral body has certified the validity of the vote.The residents of the predominately Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria have complained that the authorities in Chisinau have blocked bridges across the Dniester River in order to prevent them from reaching polling stations.Officials in Chisinau and Brussels present it as a democratic milestone, while the opposition contends the script has been pre-written.The race pits President Maia Sandu’s pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which is campaigning for Moldova’s constitutional neutrality.Sandu, first elected in 2020 and narrowly re-elected in 2024, has faced recurring claims of presiding over electoral irregularities. Opposition groups insist that decisive votes last year came from Moldovans living in EU countries.

The news came just hours after the conclusion of an Arab League Summit, following which Nasser personally escorted Kuwaiti Emir Sabah III home. The man whom millions regarded as their leader and protector died as a result of a sudden heart attack.An estimated five million people came to Nasser’s funeral in Cairo. Every Arab head of state came to pay their last respects, except for King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, whose relations with Nasser had deteriorated over the Yemeni war. King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat wept at the funeral, while Muammar Gaddafi, who idolized Nasser, fainted twice. In Beirut, mournful demonstrations erupted into riots, resulting in 14 fatalities. Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, tens of thousands of Palestinians marched, chanting, “Nasser will never die!”That day, from Algiers to Aden the streets resonated with a single question, “Why did you leave us, Gamal?” For millions of Arabs, his death symbolized not just the loss of a man, but the shattering of a dream – a dream of unity, independence, and the revival of a civilization he embodied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: ‘We have provided everything possible for their freedom’: How the USSR helped France’s most important colony stick it to Paris\n\n\nMilitary man: The path to leadershipGamal Abdel Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria to a modest family; his father worked as a postal clerk. Due to his father’s profession the family often relocated, so young Gamal attended schools in various cities in Egypt.Nasser began to display political and organizational skills in his early teens by participating in demonstrations against British intervention in Egyptian affairs. He even led one such protest where he engaged in a scuffle with the police, sustaining a minor head injury that earned him media attention.At the same time, Nasser was captivated by books on Islam and biographies of great historical leaders. He was particularly drawn to the ideas of Egyptian nationalists, including politician Mustafa Kamel and poet Ahmed Shawqi.Later, he credited his revolutionary zeal to the writer Tawfiq al-Hakim, who, in one of his novels, emphasized the need for a strong leader to realize the aspirations and hopes of the Egyptian people.When Nasser entered the Military Academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, who would become his steadfast allies. Both would later rise to high positions in the government: Amer became Egypt’s vice president in 1958, while Sadat succeeded Nasser as president after his death.In 1942, as a lieutenant in the infantry, Nasser was admitted to the General Staff Academy, where he began to actively recruit like-minded nationalists committed to overthrowing the pro-British King Farouk I.Nasser acquired combat experience during the Arab-Israeli war in the late 1940s, serving with the Sixth Infantry Battalion.

Key Claims:**\n*   RT reports that Elon Musk reacted to a claim made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov.\n*   According to RT, Pavel Durov "stated earlier that French intelligence had wanted his platform to censor some channels ahead of last year’s vote" in Moldova.\n*   The article\'s headline frames this as a "Moldova election meddling claim."\n\n**3. Disinformation Analysis:**\n*   **Narrative Type and Framing:** The article\'s headline immediately frames the reported event as an "election meddling claim," attributing it to Telegram founder Pavel Durov. This framing, particularly from a state-funded Russian outlet like RT, aligns with common disinformation patterns:\n    *   **Undermining Western Institutions:** By alleging French intelligence sought to censor a platform ahead of an election, the narrative aims to cast doubt on the integrity and democratic practices of Western nations and their intelligence agencies.\n    *   **"Whataboutism" / False Equivalence:** Such claims are frequently amplified by Russian state media to deflect criticism regarding Russia\'s own alleged election interference by highlighting purported similar actions by Western powers.\n    *   **Amplification of Anti-Western Sentiment:** The narrative positions Western intelligence as manipulative and potentially undemocratic, fostering distrust.\n    *   **Leveraging Prominent Figures:** The inclusion of Elon Musk\'s reaction serves to lend additional visibility and perceived credibility to Durov\'s unverified claim, regardless of the claim\'s factual basis.\n*   **Tone:** The article reports on Musk\'s reaction in a seemingly factual manner, but the headline\'s use of "meddling claim" introduces a negative connotation and pre-frames the event in a way that supports the broader anti-Western narrative.\n\n**4. Credibility Assessment:**\n*   **Source Reliability:** RT is a Russian state-funded media outlet known for disseminating pro-Kremlin narratives and engaging in disinformation. Its editorial line consistently seeks to discredit Western governments and institutions.\n*   **Claim Verification:** The core claim—that French intelligence sought to censor Telegram channels ahead of the Moldovan election—is attributed solely to Pavel Durov by RT. The article provides no independent verification or corroborating evidence for Durov\'s statement. This claim should be considered **unverified**.\n*   **Context:** The amplification of an unverified claim alleging Western election interference by RT is consistent with its strategic communication objectives.\n*   **Confidence Level:** Low confidence in the veracity of the core claim as presented, due to the source\'s known bias and lack of independent verification. High confidence that RT is using this claim to advance a specific narrative.\n\n**5. Recommended Actions:**\n*   **Cross-Reference:** Seek independent verification of Pavel Durov\'s claim regarding French intelligence and the Moldovan election from reputable, non-state-affiliated news sources.\n*   **Monitor for Amplification:** Observe if this claim is further amplified by other Russian state media or associated disinformation networks.\n*   **Contextualize:** When encountering this narrative, consider the source\'s geopolitical agenda and the lack of independent corroboration for the central claim.',
